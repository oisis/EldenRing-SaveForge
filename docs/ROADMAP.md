## Done

### v0.2 — Core
- Save file loading (PC `.sl2` + PS4 `memory.dat`), AES-128 decrypt/encrypt, MD5 checksums
- Character stats editing, inventory management (add/remove items), item database with icons
- SteamID patching, bidirectional PC ↔ PS4 conversion, backup manager

### v0.3–v0.4 — Event Flags & World State
- Event Flags parser (~840 precomputed + BST fallback for 14.7M flags)
- NPC Quest State Editor (36 NPCs, step-by-step progression)
- Boss Kill / Respawn Manager (~120 bosses, single defeat flag)
- Sites of Grace toggle (~460 graces), Unlock All with boss arena filter
- Map Exploration & Fog of War removal (unique feature — no other editor touches FoW)
- Summoning Pools (165), Colosseums (3), Invasion Regions (78 IDs via RebuildSlot)
- Dungeon entrance door auto-unlock (22/25 confirmed via binary diff RE)

### v0.5 — Inventory & Progression
- Cookbook/Recipe checklist, Gesture unlock (57 gestures), Bell Bearing sync (62 entries)
- AoW acquisition flags (116 entries), Great Rune manager, NG+ cycle editor (0-7)
- Talisman Pouch slots, Spirit Ash upgrade level editing
- Item Descriptions & Stats (sourced from ERDB regulation.bin)

### v0.6 — Safety & Categorization
- Ban-risk awareness system (Tier 0/1/2 + Online Safety Mode) → spec/32
- Item Caps enforcement + NG+ scaling + Full Chaos Mode → spec/34
- DB categorization audit (Information tab, 105 items reclassified) → spec/33
- Inventory & Item Database 1:1 game-aligned (18 tabs, ~70 sub-categories) → spec/36
- Container enforcement for Throwing Pots & Aromatics (Cracked/Ritual/Hefty/Perfume caps)

### v0.7 — Safety & Architecture
- RebuildSlotFull — crash-safe slot rebuild replacing FlushGaItems (DLC/Hash preservation)
- Transactional item adding (ALL-OR-NOTHING with pre-flight + snapshot/rollback) → spec/43
- Character Appearance Presets (Mirror Favorites write, 20+ presets, cross-gender) → spec/31
- SSH Deploy + remote game control (Steam Deck workflow) — target management, SFTP, launch/stop
- Undo/Redo (stack depth=5, per-slot deep copy, "Undo" button in sidebar)
- Save file diffing — "Review Changes" dialog before save (inventory, graces, bosses diff)

### v0.8 — Network/PvP
- Faster Invasions — NetworkParam break-in params (interval/timeout/targets) + regulation.bin pipeline (AES→DCX→BND4→PARAM)
- PvP/Networking tab — role-based tuning (Invader/Host/Cooperator/Blue) with presets → spec/44
- Auto-collect world pickups (Golden Seed, Sacred Tear, Scadutree Fragment, Revered Spirit Ash) — 117 pickup flags from ItemLotParam_map, auto-flagged on inventory add + manual Collect All in World Tab

### UI/UX Redesign ("Elden Ring SaveForge")
- Theme system (Dark/Light/Elden Ring), tab consolidation (7→5 tabs)
- Reusable AccordionSection, World Tab sub-tabs (Exploration/Progress/Unlocks)
- QuakeConsole + ToastBar, Inventory/Database split view, rebranding

### v0.8.x — Inventory integrity bugfixes
- **NextEquipIndex visibility gate** — binary write-back on load: saves with `NextEquipIndex < NextAcquisitionSortId` gap (from external editors) are corrected in-binary on open, so items added before are immediately visible in-game without re-adding
- **NextEquipIndex max-guard on add** — replaced `++` with `max(NextEquipIndex, acqIdx) + 1`: gap can never grow during an editor session regardless of pre-existing counter state
- **`common_item_count` header** — reconciled on load and updated on add/remove: fixes "inventory full" false-positive and wrong in-game insertion index after external editor sessions
- **Orphaned GaItem cleanup** — `RemoveItemFromSlot` clears GaItem binary record; `RepairOrphanedGaItems()` purges stale entries from pre-corruption saves
- **Round-trip tests** — `recalculatedRegions()` excludes intentionally-corrected bytes; `TestAcquisitionSortIdIncrementFix` rewrit to assert visibility invariant

### Sort Order — dual-grid Inventory + Storage with bidirectional transfer
- **Dual-grid Sort Order tab** — Storage on the left, Inventory on the right; identical 5×6 frames; per-category tabs (weapons, talismans, head, chest, arms, legs) → spec/53
- **Bidirectional drag/drop transfer** — single and multi-item; Ctrl/Cmd toggle + Shift range selection per side; dragging a selected item moves the whole source-side batch; unsaved-preview guards on both sides
- **Duplicate-instance rehandle** — talisman / weapon / armor with the same handle on both sides triggers a rehandle path: new globally-unique handle + new GaItem entry + GaMap mapping → the same item can live in Storage and Inventory simultaneously
- **Inventory Apply Order** — `ReorderInventory` with stride-2 acquisition index (see spec/52); inventory-only mutation, monotonic counter advance
- **Storage Apply Order** — `ReorderStorage` mirrors the inventory path on `slot.Storage` (also stride-2 — same `acqIdx >> 1` bucketing applies in-storage); storage-only mutation, no touch to inventory bytes or counters
- **Storage Acquisition Ordering** — `GetStorageOrder` reads the real per-record `Index`; freshly transferred items receive monotonic indices and appear at the end of Acquisition ↑ on the destination side
- **VM visibility fix** — `mapItems` resolves itemIDs via `GaMap` first (`HandleToItemID` fallback) so rehandled instances are visible in inventory/storage view models immediately after transfer

### Sort Order — per-tile Weapon Edit Modal
- **Weapon edit icon on weapon tiles** — red top-left icon in Sort Order → Weapons grid for Inventory and Storage; opens a per-weapon modal without leaving the tab
- **Upgrade level edit** — new `App.ApplyWeaponUpgradeLevel` endpoint over `core.PatchWeaponItemID`; validates base weapon, infusion offset, and `MaxUpgrade`
- **Infusion edit** — reuses `ApplyWeaponInfusion`; preserves level across affinity changes
- **Ash of War edit** — strict-only assignment via `ApplyWeaponAoWStrict`, search, availability/status badges, Remove AoW, and fail-closed handling for unknown compatibility
- **Sort Order safe refresh** — modal patches metadata by handle, preserving pending preview order and drag/drop state

## Planned

### 🟡 PvP Presets — Advanced → Presets tab (one-click PvP build setup)

One-click curated build templates for invasions, duels, and PvP-ready characters.
Replaces the "Coming Soon" placeholder in **Advanced → Presets** (currently `PvPTab.tsx`).
**Mockup:** `tmp/presets-mockup.png` | **Design:** spec/52 (to be created)

#### UI (based on mockup)

Left panel — preset browser:
- Search field + filter chips: All · Built-in · Custom · Invasions · Duels
- Preset list cards (name, RL badge, category tag, starting class hint)

Right panel — preset details:
- Header: preset name, tags (RL · category · starting class)
- **What will be applied** — per-section checkbox list, togglable before apply
- **Build Summary** — stats preview + weapon/armor/talisman/spell list with upgrade/affinity details
- **Apply Mode** radio at bottom:
  - *Build Only* — stats + inventory + equipment; world-state untouched
  - *Build + PvP Travel* — build + key Sites of Grace + map reveal (travel convenience)
  - *Full PvP Ready* — build + summoning pools + all PvP-relevant world unlocks defined in preset
- Action row: **Apply Preset** · **Save as Custom** · **Export JSON** · **Manage Presets**

#### Built-in presets (starter library, ~5)

| Preset | RL | Category | Use case |
|---|---|---|---|
| RL30 Stormveil Invader | 30 | Invasion | Early-game twink |
| RL60 Liurnia Invader | 60 | Invasion | Mid-game dex |
| RL90 Altus Invader | 90 | Invasion | Altus plateau |
| RL125 Duelist Meta | 125 | Duel | Standard bracket |
| RL150 Endgame Hybrid | 150 | Duel | End-game hybrid |

#### What a preset can contain

- **Character:** level, stats (Vig/Min/End/Str/Dex/Int/Fai/Arc), runes, starting class hint
- **Inventory:** weapons (base ID + upgrade level + affinity offset + socketed AoW), armor, talismans, spells/incantations, consumables, multiplayer items (effigies, cipher rings, fingers), flask setup
- **Equipment slots:** pre-equipped weapon/armor/talismans (applied after inventory add)
- **PvP readiness** (optional — Travel/Full modes only): map reveal, Sites of Grace selection, summoning pools

#### Out of scope

NPC quest progression, boss kills, story endings, narrative flags, "unlock everything" world state.
`Full PvP Ready` applies only the PvP-relevant subset defined in the preset — not a blanket world unlock.

#### Preset JSON schema (`schemaVersion: 1`)

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": 1,
  "type": "preset",
  "id": "rl60_liurnia_invader",
  "name": "RL60 Liurnia Invader",
  "description": "Balanced dex build optimized for Liurnia invasions.",
  "category": "PvP / Invasion",
  "tags": ["pvp", "invasion", "rl60", "dex"],
  "recommendedStartingClass": "Warrior",
  "editable": {
    "stats": true, "weapons": true, "armor": true, "talismans": true,
    "spells": true, "consumables": true, "multiplayerItems": true,
    "maps": true, "sitesOfGrace": true, "summoningPools": true
  },
  "payload": {
    "stats": {},
    "inventory": {},
    "equipment": {},
    "pvpReadiness": { "maps": {}, "sitesOfGrace": {}, "summoningPools": {} }
  }
}
```

Built-in presets ship as embedded JSON files (Go `embed`); each item is resolved by `BaseID`
against existing `backend/db` data — no raw offsets, no hardcoded byte blobs.

#### Safety

- Preview diff shown before apply (per-section summary of what changes)
- Per-section toggles in "What will be applied" — user controls exactly what gets written
- Preset validated before apply: unknown item IDs warned, quantity capped per spec/34, stat floor checked
- Unknown/unrecognised JSON sections are silently ignored or surfaced as warnings — never auto-applied
- World-state / PvP readiness: applied **only** in Travel or Full modes, never in Build Only
- PvP readiness warnings mirror spec/32 risk tier system

#### Implementation phases

1. **Preset model + JSON schema** — Go struct `PvPPreset`, JSON marshal/unmarshal, `schemaVersion` validation
2. **Preset loader + validation** — `LoadBuiltInPresets()`, `LoadPresetFromFile()`, `ValidatePreset()` (IDs, qty caps, stat floor)
3. **UI shell** — `PresetsTab.tsx`: left list + right detail panel, search + filter chips, apply mode radio, action row
4. **Preview / diff engine** — `PreviewPresetApply()` returns per-section change summary before commit
5. **Apply engine** — `ApplyPreset(charIdx, preset, mode, toggles)`: reuses `AddItemsToCharacter`, `ApplyVMToParsedSlot`, `ApplyPvPPreparation`; pushes undo before apply
6. **Built-in preset library** — 5 JSON presets compiled-in via Go `embed`; items resolved by BaseID against `backend/db`
7. **Custom preset import/export** — `SaveAsCustomPreset()` (file dialog), `ImportCustomPreset()` (validate + add to custom list), Manage Presets list
8. **Safety + manual testing** — end-to-end on PS4 save: each mode, each built-in preset, invalid JSON, apply → save → load → verify

#### Acceptance criteria

- Advanced → Presets no longer shows "Coming Soon"
- Built-in preset list visible and filterable (All / Built-in / Custom / Invasions / Duels)
- Selecting a preset populates right panel (Build Summary + What will be applied)
- Per-section toggles adjust what gets written before apply
- Apply Mode controls world-state writes: SoG/map/pools absent in Build Only
- Applied preset → stats + inventory match preset definition after save/reload
- Save as Custom → file dialog → JSON written with correct schema
- Import JSON → validated → appears in Custom filter
- Invalid/unknown JSON sections do not silently corrupt the save

**Effort:** ~30-40h (all 8 phases) | **Depends on:** spec/43 (transactional add), spec/32 (risk tiers), `ApplyPvPPreparation` (existing in `app_pvp.go`)

### 🔵 Advanced Save Editor — power-user / research tab
Single tab under **Advanced → Save Editor** for reading and writing known and experimental save values across three technically distinct layers: Event Flags, regulation snapshot params, and raw offsets.

MVP: known EventFlags read/write, manual EventFlag by ID, NetworkParam fields (NETWORK_PARAM_ST), app-known macros, pending changes list, preview diff, atomic Apply, Export patch report.
Not in MVP: raw offset editor, full regulation browser, ShopLineupParam/ItemLotParam write support, patch import/export.
**Design:** [spec/51](spec/51-advanced-save-editor.md) | **Effort:** estimated 20-30h (MVP only)

### 🟡 Character Preset Export/Import — JSON build sharing
Export/import stats + inventory + storage + appearance to portable `.preset.json`.
Replaces disabled `App.ImportCharacter`. Community build sharing.
**Design:** [spec/37](spec/37-character-presets.md) | **Effort:** 10-14h (Phase 1+2 MVP)

### 🟡 Boss Kill — multi-flag rework
Current single-flag approach grants runes but boss remains alive. Needs arena state + quest progression + grace activation flags per boss.
**Design:** [spec/38](spec/38-boss-multiflag.md) | **Reference:** `tmp/repos/er-save-manager/src/er_save_manager/data/boss_data.py` (208 bosses)

### 🟡 DB Cleanup — cut-content, multiplayer dedup, error items
Fix `[ERROR]` items in-game, remove empty flask duplicates, dedup multiplayer active/inactive states, flag uncertain cut-content.
**Design:** [spec/40](spec/40-db-cleanup-plan.md) | **Effort:** 4-6 iterations

### 🟡 Bell Bearing Merchant Kill Flag
Auto-set merchant NPC kill event flag when their Bell Bearing is unlocked. Prevents duplicate drops and broken dialogue.
**Investigation needed:** map merchant BB item ID → NPC kill flag (overlaps with quest_flags_db.py)

### 🟡 Info-tab ground drop — investigation paused
Adding Info items (Notes, About tutorials) causes world copies to drop on the ground. Cosmetic only, no ban risk.
Two approaches tried (world pickup flags + TutorialDataChunk), neither gates the spawn.
**Research:** [spec/41](spec/41-info-tab-ground-drop.md) | **Blocker:** need EMEVD decompilation

### 🟢 AoW Socketing + Infusion Edit — in-editor weapon customization

Edit socketed Ash of War and infusion affinity per weapon directly from Inventory tab.

**UI:** "AoW/Infuse Edit" toggle button (next to Add Favorites in InventoryTab) switches table to edit mode.
In edit mode: only eligible weapons shown (melee_armaments + ranged_armaments that support gem socketing), two dropdown columns — **Infusion** and **Ash of War**.

**AoW rules:**
- Dropdown shows only AoW from player's **inventory** (not storage — must be moved first, matching in-game behavior).
- AoW items display "In Use · WeaponName" badge when already socketed on another weapon.
- Weapons that don't support AoW (Seals, Staves, fixed-skill weapons) are hidden from edit mode view.

**Infusion rules:**
- Infusion is baked into `GaItemFull.ItemID` (`BaseID + infuseOffset + upgrade`); changing affinity = rewriting ItemID.
- Only affinities allowed by the weapon are shown (source: `EquipParamWeapon.disableGemAttr` bitmask from regulation.bin CSV — **needs pre-import into db**).

**Implementation phases:**

1. **Research** — parse `EquipParamWeapon.gemMountType` (column 248) to build a set of weapon BaseIDs that support AoW socketing; parse `disableGemAttr` (column 134) per weapon to know which affinities are valid. Import both as lookup maps into `backend/db/data/`.

2. **Backend: read** — extend `ItemViewModel` with:
   - `AttachedAoWID uint32`, `AttachedAoWName string` (read from `GaItemFull.AoWGaItemHandle`)
   - `InUseByWeapon string` (resolved by scanning all weapon GaItems for matching `AoWGaItemHandle`)
   - `AllowedInfusions []int` (from `disableGemAttr` lookup)

3. **Backend: write** — two new endpoints in `app.go`:
   - `SetWeaponAoW(charIdx, weaponHandle, aowItemID uint32) error` — updates `GaItemFull.AoWGaItemHandle`; aowItemID=0 clears it (`0xFFFFFFFF`)
   - `SetWeaponInfusion(charIdx, weaponHandle, infuseOffset uint32) error` — rewrites `GaItemFull.ItemID` = `BaseID + infuseOffset + currentUpgrade`; validates infuseOffset against `disableGemAttr`

4. **Frontend** — `InventoryTab.tsx`:
   - "AoW/Infuse Edit" button toggles `editMode` state
   - In edit mode: filter to eligible armaments, show two dropdown columns
   - AoW dropdown sources from inventory AoW items (`category === "Ash of War"`, not storage)
   - Infusion dropdown sources from `AllowedInfusions` on the weapon ViewModel

**Mockup (v1, superseded):** `tmp/mockups/aow-socketing-mockup.html`

### 🟢 Lost Ash of War — Key Items support
"Lost Ash of War" (used at Sites of Grace to duplicate AoWs) must be addable from Key Items tab. Verify item is correctly categorized as `key_items` in `backend/db/data/` and not missing or miscategorized. Also check `Lost Spirit Ash` (same mechanic for spirit ashes).

### 🟢 Ban Detector — save file risk scan
Scan a save file for content that is known or suspected to trigger server-side bans. Surfaces findings per-slot in the Tools tab without requiring the file to be loaded for editing.

**Checks (✅ = data available now):**
- ✅ Cut content / `ban_risk` items in inventory + storage (uses existing `db.go` flags)
- ✅ Any attribute > 99
- ✅ Character level > 713
- ✅ Weapon upgrade level above vanilla cap (+25 standard / +10 somber; encoded in item ID)
- ✅ SteamID embedded in save vs. expected account
- ⚠️ Soul Memory mismatch (`current_runes + spent_runes ≠ total_runes_earned`) — needs `total_runes_earned` offset RE
- ⚠️ Boss loot without kill event flags — needs boss_item_id → event_flag mapping

**Output:** per-slot report with risk tier (High / Medium / Info), item list, and plain-language explanation. Optional JSON export.

**Design:** → spec/45 §3 (trigger reference)

### 🟢 Safe Weapon De-leveling — matchmaking bracket control
Scan character's max weapon upgrade level (determines PvP matchmaking bracket), offer safe downgrade.
Useful for PvP builds targeting specific level ranges without starting new character.

### 🟢 Save Corruption Detection UI
Backend `DiagnoseSaveCorruption()` exists. Needs frontend display + auto-repair for recoverable issues.

### 🟢 Dungeon Door Flags — remaining 4 entries
War-Dead Catacombs (requires Radahn defeat), 3 DLC catacombs (m61 tiles, `20{col}{row}{ObjAct}` format).
